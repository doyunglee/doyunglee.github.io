      For a year, <b>I was a UX + graphic designer, project manager, and curriculum developer</b> in a team working with Coahoma community members and organizations; these groups are addressing challenges in providing the youth of Coahoma with the necessary resources to be successful. Below are some of the design works I did to help the team understand and get feedback from the community.
      </p>
    <h2 class="section-header">Co-Designing with Youth</h2>
      <p class="section-text">
      We co-designed with youth in Coahoma County to learn more about available and missing learning resources in their community. I helped design an activty (shown below) that allowed the students to imagine a new learning space, which helped us begin conversations about their needs and values.
      </p>

      <p class="section-text">
      With this activity, we were able to get ideas and have conversations with over 100 Coahoma youth. This information helped us narrow down to 5 potential ideas for a learning space in Coahoma County. 
      </p>
      <p class="majorkey">
      KEY TAKEAWAYS: Coahoma youth are very much interested in music, entrepreneurship and the arts. Many of the youth feel uncomfortable in the city, and want a safe, youth-centered space where they can study, learn and hang out.
