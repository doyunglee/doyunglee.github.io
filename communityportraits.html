      <h4 class="projoverview">My Role:</h4>
      <p class="overviewtext">Designer</p>
      <h4 class="projoverview">What I Did:</h4>
      <p class="overviewtext">I worked with the Cambridge Public Library to design and build a pop-up photo booth that allowed patrons to take portraits of themselves and share why they were visiting the library that day. This was a solo project while I was at Harvard’s Library Innovation Lab.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="section-header">Photo Booth Prototype 1</h2>
    <p id="regular-text"> I created an initial prototype to playtest what the interaction would be like using IFTTT applets and a web automation software. The photos taken were uploaded onto a tumblr page for people to see. After playtesting, I decided on a few goals:
    <br>
    <i>1.) I wanted the photo booth to take high quality photos of patrons, and have them displayed close by.
    <br>
    2.) I also wanted the patrons to be able to share what they were doing at the library that day.
    <br>
    3.) I wanted tohe photo booth to be made with affordable materials, and easily setup, broken down, and stored in a public library.</i>

    <br>
    <h2 class="section-header">Testing Prototype 2 at the Library</h2>
    <p id="regular-text">I set up prototype 2 at the front of the Cambridge Public Library for a few days to observe patron interactions.
    </p>

    <p id="regular-text">The library patrons also left behind some wonderful portraits!</p>

    <p id="photo-caption-small">What are doing at the library today?: “Getting some work done for the new school year (we are teachers)”</p>

    Key Takeaways:
    <br>
    &gt; Many patrons thought the screen was a touchscreen. There were too many ways to interact with the photo booth (button, mouse, screen, keyboard). In the next version, redesign to a simpler touchscreen interface.
    <br>
    &gt; The photo booth was too high for younger patrons, so their portraits usually only had the upper half of their heads in them.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="section-header">Photo Booth Interface Redesign</h2>
    <p id="regular-text">After observing patrons interact with the prototype, I worked on a redesign where the interaction is completely with a touchscreen.</p>
    <div class="iframe-container">
      <iframe style="border: none;" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2F2PfZTKReRkCOQgOfMta24a%2FCommunity-Photo-Booth%3Fnode-id%3D2%253A13%26scaling%3Dscale-down" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>
    <p id="photo-caption">You can try out the redesign interface here</p>
    <br>
    <p id="regular-text">
    I also envisioned a redesign of the structure so it is lower in height, with a stool for people to sit. This height will make the photo booth more accessible to younger patrons, as well as wheelchair users.

    <h2 class="section-header">Next Steps</h2>
    <p id="regular-text">
    Test out new touchscreen interface with patrons, build out display area where portraits can be shared, and build an online archive of the portraits.
