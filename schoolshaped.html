          <p class="section-text">
          I was an advisor for a non-profit called School Shaped during the Fall semester of 2015. The team formed when a group of us saw that teachers had ideas about how to improve their classroom experiences, but did not have the time or the resources to carry them out. We were also a group of engineers who were passionate about education. We met with teachers, shadowed them, dicussed potential tools, and prototyped something for them. I helped advise two engineering teams that created web tools for teachers in the Greater Boston area.

          KEY TAKEAWAY: Schools and startups move at very different speeds, and it is difficult to expand out from software-based tools due to cost+scalability.
